# OboxSystemsTestTask

## Objective
Your goal is to showcase your ability to build a modern, non-standard, and interactive user interface. We want to see your problem-solving skills and your eye for detail in creating polished, engaging web experiences.

## The Task
Reproduce the core user interface and scroll-driven experience of this cinematic website:
**[https://wakanda-forever-master.dogstudio-dev.co/zerolimits](https://wakanda-forever-master.dogstudio-dev.co/zerolimits)**

Your solution should be as close as possible to the original in terms of layout, typography, and animations.

## The Creative Challenge (Replacing the 3D)
The original site is built around a complex 3D animation. **You are not required to replicate the 3D model.**

Instead, we want you to creatively replace it with a solution that maintains the site's immersive and cinematic feel. This is where you can demonstrate your problem-solving skills. Some ideas include:

*   A high-quality, looping video background (AI-generated or stock).
*   An abstract generative animation using CSS, Canvas, or WebGL (e.g., particles, shaders).
*   A clever parallax effect with 2D image layers.
*   Any other creative solution you think fits the aesthetic.

## Key Areas to Focus On

*   **Scroll-driven Animations:** The synchronization of scrolling with element transitions (fade, move, scale) is the most critical aspect.
*   **Layout & Typography:** Match the visual structure, font styles, and spacing.
*   **Performance:** The experience should be smooth and responsive.
*   **Overall Atmosphere:** Capture the "feel" of the original site.

## Technical Requirements

*   You are free to use any modern front-end framework (React, Vue, Svelte) or vanilla JavaScript.
*   Animation libraries like GSAP, Framer Motion, or ScrollTrigger are encouraged.
*   The code must be your own.

## Deliverables

1.  **Source Code:** Commit all your final source code to this repository.
2.  **Live Deployment:** Add the link to your live, deployed solution in the `report.md` file.

### Video Walkthrough

The video walkthrough is a crucial part of your submission. It's your opportunity to showcase not just the final product, but also your thought process, problem-solving skills, and technical decisions. Think of it as a brief presentation to our team.

#### Guidelines & Tools

  **Length:** Please keep the video concise, around **3-5 minutes with your voice explanations of the process**.
  **Recording Software:** You can use any screen recording tool you are comfortable with. Free and popular options include **OBS Studio**, **Bandicam**, **Loom**, or the built-in recorders in Windows (Win+G) and macOS (Cmd+Shift+5).
  **Video Hosting:** Please provide shared access to the video link on Google Drive.
    > ‚ùó **Important:** Please do not send the video file as an email attachment. You must commit it to your repository.
  **Focus:** We value clarity and substance over production quality. A simple screen recording with clear audio is perfect.

#### What to Cover in Your Video

Please structure your walkthrough to cover the following points:

1.  **Project Demonstration (The "What")**
    *   Start with a brief tour of the finished project.
    *   Show the main features in action and demonstrate that the core requirements of the task have been met.
    *   Walk us through the primary user flow or interaction path.

2.  **Approach & Architecture (The "Why")**
    *   Briefly explain your interpretation of the task's main challenge.
    *   Describe the overall architecture or approach you took and, most importantly, **why you chose it**. (e.g., Why did you structure your code this way? What was your strategy for the most complex part?).

3.  **Technical Highlights (The "How")**
    *   Highlight 1-2 key technical decisions you made. You don't need to explain your entire codebase.
    *   **Good topics to mention:**
        *   Your choice of a key library, framework, or technology and the reason behind it.
        *   A design pattern or code structure you implemented (e.g., component architecture, state management, API design).
        *   How you solved a specific technical problem, like performance optimization, data handling, or a complex algorithm.
    *   Feel free to show a specific code snippet you are proud of and briefly explain its purpose.

4.  **AI Tool Usage**
    *   Please state whether you used AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT) while working on the project.
    *   If you did, briefly mention which tools you used and for what purpose (e.g., "for generating boilerplate code," "for brainstorming solutions," or "for debugging a specific issue").

5.  **Reflection (Optional but Encouraged)**
    *   Briefly mention any potential limitations of your current solution or what you would improve or add if you had more time. This demonstrates foresight and a good understanding of trade-offs.

We are excited to see your interpretation and how you tackle the challenge.
